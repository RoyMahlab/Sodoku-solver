# Recursive Sodoku-solver
Solving any size of sodoku table using recursion
# main 
main holds the initiation of the class 'sodoku solver' and the initial sudoko board and board size as parameters
# sodoku_solver 
implemented as a class, which holds in it self the recursive oprating function - 'insert_new_num'
# How to opperate
so for a 9x9 sodoku board keep parameter n as 3 which states the size of inner squares. n could obviously be changed to any size as long as the given table is at an appropriate size. At the bottom of the main you have a commented blanc board, replace it with the example board given in main to any kind of wanted board and run main.py file with sodoku_solver.py in the same directory.
